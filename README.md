## Overview

The Employee Leave Management System is designed to help companies efficiently manage employee leave requests and balances. It enables employees to submit vacation requests, tracks available leave days, and calculates any applicable payouts for unused leave.

This project will focus on providing a user-friendly interface for employees and administrators, as well as a robust backend to handle leave calculations, validations, and data persistence.

The application will be developed iteratively, with features added progressively after each assigned task. This approach ensures clear progress and allows for continuous improvement based on feedback.
