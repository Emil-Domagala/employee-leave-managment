# Employee Leave Management System

## Overview

The Employee Leave Management System is a web application that allows companies to manage employee leave requests efficiently.  
Employees can request vacation days, and the system automatically calculates:

- The number of leave days available.
- Leave approval status based on company policies.
- Payout for unused or extra leave days, if applicable.

This project is built using **Nest.js** for the backend, TypeOrm as the ORM, and **PostgreSQL** as the primary database.

The system aims to streamline HR processes, reduce manual work, and maintain a transparent leave history for employees and administrators.
